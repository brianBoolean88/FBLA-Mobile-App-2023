# üë®‚Äçüç≥ ChefLens: AI-Powered Cooking Assistant  

ChefLens is a Flutter mobile application that uses AI to analyze photos of your ingredients and generate personalized recipe suggestions along with nutritional information. The app is built with Dart using Flutter in Visual Studio Code and connects to a continuation project called **Food Image AI Predictor**, powered by Google Colab and trained on the **Fruit Classification Dataset** (22k images) by Edward Zhang.

## üì± Introduction

**ChefLens** is designed to help users, especially amateur cooks and college students, prepare nutritious meals from the ingredients they have on hand. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the app identifies ingredients in user-submitted photos and recommends suitable recipes with detailed nutritional breakdowns.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Many people struggle with meal planning based on the ingredients they have, especially:
- College students with limited ingredients and experience.
- Busy individuals without time to search for recipes.
- Families trying to eat healthy on a budget.

Currently available apps are either paywalled, overly complex, or have poor UI/UX. ChefLens addresses this by offering:
- A **free and AI-driven** recipe generation tool.
- Intuitive and clean user interface.
- Nutritional and dietary customization options.

## üéØ Target Audience

- **College students**
- **Amateur cooks**

## üí° Solution Overview

ChefLens works in two main stages:

1. **Image Ingredient Detection**
   - Users snap a photo of their available ingredients.
   - Images are sent to a machine learning backend (Google Colab model).
   - The model classifies and returns identified ingredients.

2. **AI-Generated Recipe & Nutrition Info**
   - The app suggests recipes sorted by user preferences:
     - Calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats
     - Vitamins, minerals, fiber, allergens
     - Cooking time & difficulty level
   - Each recipe includes step-by-step instructions and optional tutorial videos.

- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (included with Flutter)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or Xcode (macOS) --> for virtual device if needed
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Flutter & Dart extensions
- Git CLI
- Device/emulator for testing

### üì• Installation Steps
